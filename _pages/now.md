This is a <a target="_blank" href="http://nownownow.com/about">/now</a> page.

I'm currently studying for my masters in computer science at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/">TUM</a>. I live in Munich
and work on data-driven technologies for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.airbusgroup.com/int/en/people-careers/apprentices-and-pupils/In-Germany/schuler/location-muenchen-ottobrunn.html">Airbus</a>.

This semester I'm learning about applying machine learning methods to problems in biology (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rostlab.org/teaching/ss14/pp1cs">Protein Prediction</a>) and how to use technology to create new digital business models.
